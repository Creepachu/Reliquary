Description
=========

An unoffical repository of Reliquary!

Originally made by x3n0ph0b3 and TheMike, Reliquary is now maintained by P3pp3rF1y, but this fork was made to tweak some settings which are not tweakable through the config file.

Building
=========

We use ForgeGradle. There are instructions inside the 'build.gradle' file in this repository.

Licence
=========

The licence is located at COPYING.txt, but to save you the trouble, it's GPLv3 (with one of the sounds under CC Attribution License). 

Basically, do whatever you want, as long as it's free, open source, and stays under GPL. (Yes, that allows you to use it in your modpack.)
